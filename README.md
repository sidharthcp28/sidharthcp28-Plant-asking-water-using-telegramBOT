A small project using Node MCU ESP8266 board and soil moisture sensor YL-69/YL-39 forPlant asking water using telegramBOT

This project “Plant asking water using Telegram BOT” is the a smart device that’d monitors’ plant watering needs and soil moisture levels. The device is linked to a Telegram bot, allowing the user to control the watering process. The bot updated the soil moisture level in real time and sends alerts when soil become too dry or wet. The bot also be used to set d desired soilmoisture levels, adjust watering frequency, and monitor the overall health of the plant.
Now Days we living in a technical age, The evolution of technology has led us to more stressful life. So , people started to grow plants as a hobby to relive their stress, free her minds but not many properly water and maintain it. That we making it.
The components we using Node MCU ESP8266 board its wi-fi system on chip
and soil moisture sensor YL-69/YL-39 is used and a 9V battery to power to the
board. The software using Arduino IDE is used for programming the Node
MCU using simple interface and community driven system and Telegram bot
they’’ll often have Al features.
